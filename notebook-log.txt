During Spring 2022 at UW-Madison, we took the course B563 "Phylogenetic analysis of molecular data" with Dr. Solis as instructor. 
We created a github repository for the class (Phylogenetics-563) as part of the reproducibility approach. 

1. QUALITY CONTROL

-Downloaded FastQ to run QC for the molecular data. 
-I will work with public nuclear regions from NCBI, therefore, these sequences already have gone through QC. 

2. Download NCBI Genbank sequences

-For the purposes of the course, I decided to work with nuclear regions publicly available (e.g., ITS, ETC, G3pdh) and previously used by Pederneiras et al. (2015) and Machado et al. (2018).
-All nuclear regions were downloaded from NCBI genbank as FASTA files, and stored in the FASTA FILES folder as follows: F_sp_GENEBANK ACCESSION CODE.fasta (e.g., F_maxima_KM186217.fasta)

3. QC with FastQ

-FastQ can't open FASTA files; we need SRA files to to QC for raw reads.

4. Alignment

-Downloaded ClustalW file clustalw-2.1macosx.dmg and copied the folder into Desktop/Phylogenetics-563/software
-Open the terminal and run the following command to install clustalw

conda create -n clustalw2 -c bio builds -y clustalw

-To activate clustalw in the terminal, I run this command:

conda activate clustalw2

-To make the MSA (multiple sequence alignment), I run this command:

clustalw2 -ALIGN -INFILE=FICUS_SEQUENCES_FASTA.fasta -OUTFILE=FICUS_SEQUENCES_FASTA-aligned.fasta -OUTPUT=PHYLIP

Alignment Score = 5271670
