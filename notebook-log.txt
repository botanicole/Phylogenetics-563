During Spring 2022 at UW-Madison, we took the course B563 "Phylogenetic analysis of molecular data" with Dr. Solis as instructor. 
We created a github repository for the class (Phylogenetics-563) as part of the reproducibility approach. 

1. QUALITY CONTROL

-Downloaded FastQ to run QC for the molecular data. 
-I will work with public nuclear regions from NCBI, therefore, these sequences already have gone through QC. 

2. Download NCBI Genbank sequences

-For the purposes of the course, I decided to work with nuclear regions publicly available (e.g., ITS, ETC, G3pdh, AT103, and TPI) and previously used by Pederneiras et al. (2015) and Machado et al. (2018).
-Each nuclear region was downloaded from NCBI Genbank as FASTA file, and stored in the FASTA FILES folder as follows: F_sp_GENEBANK ACCESSION CODE.fasta (e.g., F_maxima_KM186217.fasta).
-Created one .fasta file for each nuclear region and placed each corresponding sequence together (e.g., all ITS sequences for each species were placed together in the sale .fasta file). This helped in the alignment step, as each region needed to be aligned separately.

3. QC with FastQ

-FastQ can't open FASTA files; we need SRA files to to QC for raw reads.

4. Alignment

-Downloaded ClustalW file clustalw-2.1macosx.dmg and copied the folder into Desktop/Phylogenetics-563/software
-Opened the terminal and run the following command to install clustalw

>conda create -n clustalw2 -c bio builds -y clustalw

-To activate clustalw in the terminal, I run this command:

>conda activate clustalw2

-To make the MSA (multiple sequence alignment), I run this command:

>clustalw2 -ALIGN -INFILE=FICUS_SEQUENCES_FASTA.fasta -OUTFILE=FICUS_SEQUENCES_FASTA-aligned.fasta -OUTPUT=PHYLIP

Alignment Score = 5271670
