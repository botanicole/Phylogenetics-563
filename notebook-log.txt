During Spring 2022 at UW-Madison, we took the class B563 "Phylogenetic analysis of molecular data" with Claudia Solis as instructor. 
We created a github repository for all steps performed to analyse our data and achieve reproducibility.  

1. Download NCBI Genbank sequences

For the purposes of the course, I decided to work with nuclear regions publicly available (e.g., ITS, ETC, G3pdh) and previously used by Pederneiras et al. (2015) and Machado et al. (2018).
All nuclear regions were downloaded from NCBI genbank as FASTA files, and stored in the FASTA FILES folder as follows: F_sp_GENEBANK ACCESSION CODE

2. QC with FastQ

I can't open the FASTA files on this software

3. Alignment

Downloaded ClustalW file clustalw-2.1macosx.dmg and copied the folder into Desktop/Phylogenetics-563
